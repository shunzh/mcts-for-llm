Other versions may work as well.\nThen, git clone this repo and install the package:\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n## Examples\n### Using GPT-2 and UCT for Language Alignment with Positive Sentiment Reward\nRun the following command to generate texts using the GPT-2 model, guided by UCT (Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees) for language alignment. Positive sentiment is used as the reward.\n```bash\npython examples/uct_language_alignment.py\n```\n### Classic Planning Domains (Non-LLM)\nThis repository also includes some classic planning domains derived from the original Dyna Gym repo. These examples don't use LLMs but may be useful for debugging purposes."
